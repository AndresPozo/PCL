Version 00.06.03.0010 (2011-11-07):
- increased max. feather radius from 50 to 250 to adress problem described by Marco (lorenzi) in http://pixinsight.com/forum/index.php?topic=3588.msg24587#msg24587

Version 00.06.02.0009 (2011-11-06):
- GradientsHdrComposition: Fixed bug in serialization of data, identified by Geert Vanhauwaert
  and Juan Conejero http://pixinsight.com/forum/index.php?topic=3579.0
- improved linearization. Still beta.

Version 00.06.01.0008 (2011-11-04):
- Fixed some tool tips in the GradientsHdrCompression and GradientsMergeMosaic interfaces.
- Minor fixes to documentation by Juan Conejero
- Release via update-dev

Version 00.06.00.0006 (2011-11-03):
- fixed the FeatherRadius problem, also removed hint from docs
- start development of GradientHdrComposition module process
- GradientsMergeMosaic: explained creation algorithm for mask in online and bubble help
- GradientsMergeMosaic: mask did not have correct size after bugfix in last release.
- corrected name of Gradient*s*MergeMosaic.pidoc and Gradient*s*HdrCompression.pidoc
- Adding new experimental module for GradientsHDRComposition
- Adding preliminary documentation for GradientsHDRComposition
- Minor improvements to other documentation
- Updated Credits

Version 00.05.00.0003 (2011-10-15):
- integrated Juan's changes into documentation (mainly image sizes)
- added information about the contributions of others to the author tag of .pidoc
- removed head label in GUI, and set tooltip on ProcessInstance itself for
  both GradientsMergeMosaicInterface and GradientsHdrInterface. This is for conformance
  with other PI tools
- GradientsHdrCompression: reduced range of LogMin/LogMax parameter after Vicent's remark that the parameters are
  extremely sensitive. Also, the minimum logMin value is now coerced to zero instead of just
  being a small number. The defaults are all set to "neutral" now.
- GradientsHdrCompression: Improved bubble help and other help texts
- GradientsHdrCompression: Added help page.
- GradientsHdrCompression: Added module to HDR category (was Intensity Transform) to documentation
- GradientsMergeMosaic: Added reference to video tutorial to documentation
- GradientsMergeMosaic: Fixed issue identified by RBA in http://pixinsight.com/forum/index.php?topic=3295.msg23480#msg23480
- Fixed some wrong Assert() statements
- Added necessary #include to Assert.h
- Fixed bug in Assert() macro (missing ())
- Moved RgbPreserve.h/.cpp to pcl namespace (just as everything else)

 - Known issues:
 -- GradientsHdrCompression: Realtime preview sometimes does not follow settings correctly. Also
    has problems with STF.
 -- GradientsMergeMosaic with large Feather Radius values shows artefacts at the border of the merged images, if the image has a staircase structure there. This unfortunately cannot be easily avoided, and is discussed in the documentation.

Version 00.04.00.0002 (2011-07-24)
-First release that is fully functional and usually delivers results of the quality that I had in mind
